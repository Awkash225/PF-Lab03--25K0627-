This is my first Github repository.
<br>Basically I'm from Mithi, Tharparkar.
<br>I've completed my intermediate from Dr. A Q. Khan College Islamabad with fully funded scholarship (in FBISE Board) and Now Studying BSCS program at FAST-NUCES
<br>I'm interesting in C++ programming as I only know much about this language. But Python is also good but I am not acknowledged about Python.
<br>And, one more thing (regarding my eduacation interests) about me is that, I love mathematics.
